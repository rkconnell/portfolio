This repository has two files:
1. (edf.Rmd) - An R markdown file containing the analyses I did for a project with the non-profit, The Environmental Defense Fund. This project collated soil carbon data from agricultural research sites across the country to investigate the effects of fertilizer use on soil carbon storage.
2. (DoD_AOWS_Report.Rmd) - An R markdown file containing the analyses I did for a DoD-funded program at Malcolm X College. These analyses investigated the impacts the program had on underrepresented women pursuing STEM careers.
